## Description


## Examples



## Demo / Develop
There are a few different ways to run this Scratch code. It can be done offline or online. If you have a stable internet connection, the easiest way is to use Scratch's online editor.

1. [Fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) this repository and download the `.sb3` file(s) locally.

2. Open the `.sb3` file(s).

- Online:

    - a. [Get Started](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/editor/?tutorial=getStarted) with a new project on Scratch.

    - b. In the upper left of the interface, choose "File > Load from your computer."

    - c. Select the file you wish to demo or develop, and choose "Open."

- Offline:

    - a. Please see Scratch's [Downloads Page](https://scratch.mit.edu/download) for instructions about how to download and use the Scratch App offline.

3. In the upper right corner of the interface, there is a runtime window that shows the background and sprites. Above this window there is a green flag. Press the green flag to start the script and run the app. Next to the green flag is a red stop sign. Press the red stop sign to stop all scripts. In the far upper right, there is an full-screen expand icon that looks like an X. Pressing the full-screen button will make the run-time window "full" screen (a little bit bigger).

4. Enjoy!
